## Prepared a hybrid model for SENSEX prediction by integrating numerical analysis and sentiment analysis. 
## Gained top performance with the ARIMA model, using an AutoRegressive term of 3, a Differencing term of 1, and a 
## Moving Average term of 0, resulting in an MSE of 0.0268.  
## Additionally, the RandomForestRegressor executed an MSE of 0.0526. The model outperformed DecisionTree, 
## AdaBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost, significantly enhancing predictive accuracy
